[^mid]: In OE, the preposition for *with* was not *wiþ* but *mid*, which
    generally meant the same thing as modern with except for the use of *with*
    to mean *against*, as shown in *the knight fought with the dragon*.
    Meanwhile, OE *wiþ* had a few meanings related to location such as *near*
    and *toward*, but mainly meant *against*. It is likely that Norse influence
    caused *with* to mainly show instrumentality and thus caused *mid* to fall
    into disuse.
[^plant]: *plant* was derived from Old English, which got it from Latin,
    however the broader sense of "any vegetable life, vegetation generally"
    came from Old French.
