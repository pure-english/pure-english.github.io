So, I translate Genesis 1–4 into Anglish, but… I used the NIVUK version. This
version specifically has a [copyright] that forbids any changes, or
reproductions in whole.

Specifically, here is the quoted copyright text:

So yeah. I messed up… oops!

I will be redoing it, but based on the KJV version (which is public domain) and
by using a interlinear bible in order to look at the origin Hebrew and the
word-for-word translations.

In the meantime, I am also working on [The Metamorphosis][TM] by Franz Kafka,
which the original German and the translated English I'm working with is in the
public domain.

Henceforth, I will check for copyright status more stringently. Lesson learned.
