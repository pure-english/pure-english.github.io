## Story

### I
One morning, as Gregor Samsa ƿas ƿaking up from harrowing dreams, he found out
that in bed he had been ƿent into a fifelisc ƿigsum[^ƿigsum] bug. He lay on his
harƿeed-hard back and saƿ, as he lifted his head up a little, his brune,
inbowed belly split up into stiff boƿ-like deals. From this height the blanket,
nige on ready to slide off altogether, could hardly stay still. His manifold
legs, armly thin next to the rest of his felly, flickered helplessly before his
eyes.
