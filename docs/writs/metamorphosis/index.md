## Story (English spelling)

### I

One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from harrowing dreams, he found out
that in bed he had been went into a fivelish wigsome[^ƿigsum] bug. He lay on
his harweed-hard back and saw, as he heaved his head up a little, his brown,
inbowed belly shed into stiff bow-like deals. From this height the bedspread,
nigh on ready to slide off altogether, could hardly abide still. His manifold
shanks, armly thin next to the rest of his felly, flickered helplessly before
his eyes.

“What's happened to me,” he thought. It was no dream. His room, a fitting room
for a man, only somewhat too small, lay hushedly between the four well-known
walls. Above the beed, on which an unpacked hoard of foresmack[^foresmack]
cloth goods was spread out (Samsa was a wayfaring seller) hung the meting which
he had cut out of a meted monthly book a little while ago and set in a pretty
gilt rim. It was a meting of a woman mid a wildwaren[^ƿildƿaren] hat and a
wildwaren shivel. She sat aheaved there, heaving up in the steer of the
hower[^hoƿer] a stark wildwaren glove into which her whole forearm
swound[^sƿund].

Gregor's gander then trended to the eyedoor. The dreary weather (the rain drops
were falling aloud down on the bloom eyedoor ledge) made him rather sorrowful.
"Why don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and foryet all this
witlessness," he thought. But this was wholly outlandish, for he was wont to
sleeping on his right side, and in his anward hoad he couldn't yet himself into
this lie[^lie]. However hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always
trended again onto his back. He must have fanded it a hundred times, shutting
his eyes, so that he would not have to see the writhing[^ƿriþing] shanks, and
yielded only when he began to feel a light, dull smart in his side which he had
never felt before.

“O God,” he thought, “what a tiring line of work I've chosen! Day in, day out
on the road. The hardships of chaffer[^chaffer] be much greater than the work
going on at head workstead[^workstead], and, moreover, I have to deal
mid[^deal-with] the hitches of faring, the worries about *train* ties, unbiseny
ghastly food, short-lived and always shifting man sibreds which never come from
the heart. To hell mid it all!” He felt a whoonly itching on the top of his
belly. He slowly poted himself on his back nearer to the bed stock so that he
could heave his head more swimmingly, found the itchy bit, which was fully
overlaid mid small white spots (he did not know what to make of hem), and
wished to feel the spot mid a shank. But he withdrew it at once, for the
nearness felt like a cold shower all over him.

### I
One morning, as Gregor Samsa ƿas ƿaking up from harroƿing dreams, he fund ute
þat in bed he had been ƿent into a fifelisc ƿigsum[^ƿigsum] bug. He lay on his
harƿeed-hard back and saƿ, as he heafed his head up a littel, his brune,
inboƿed belly sced into stiff boƿ-like deals. From þis heigt þe bedspread, nige
on ready to slide off altogeþer, could hardly abide still. His manifold scanks,
armly þin next to þe rest of his felly, flickered helplessly before his eyes.

“Hƿat's happened to me,” he þougt. It ƿas no dream. His room, a fitting room
for a man, only sumhƿat too small, lay huscedly betƿeen þe four ƿell-knoƿn
ƿalls. Abufe þe beed, on hƿic an unpacked hoard of foresmack[^foresmack] cloþ
goods ƿas spread ute (Samsa ƿas a ƿayfaring seller) hung þe meting hƿic he had
cut ute of a meted monþly book a littel hƿile ago and set in a pretty gilt rim.
It ƿas a meting of a ƿuman mid a ƿildƿaren[^ƿildƿaren] hat and a ƿildƿaren
scifel. Sce sat aheafed þere, heafing up in þe steer of þe hoƿer[^hoƿer] a
stark ƿildƿaren glof into hƿic her hƿole[^hƿole] forearm sƿund[^sƿund].

Gregor's gander þen trended to þe eyedoor. Þe dreary ƿeaþer (þe rain drops ƿere
falling alude dune on þe bloom eyedoor ledg) made him raþer sorroƿful. "Hƿy
don't I keep sleeping for a littel hƿile longer and forget all þis
ƿitlessness," he þougt. But þis ƿas hƿolly[^hƿole] utelandisc, for he ƿas ƿont
to sleeping on his rigt side, and in his anƿard hoad he couldn't get himself
into þis lie[^lie]. Huefer hard he þreƿ himself onto his rigt side, he alƿays
trended again onto his back. He must haf fanded it a hundred times, scutting

gielded only hƿen he began to feel a ligt, dull smart in his side hƿic he had
nefer felt before.

<!-- Footnotes -->
[^ƿigsum]: Literally *characterized by insects/bugs*.
[^foresmack]: Literally *fore-* 'before' + *smack* 'taste'.
[^hoƿer]: Literally *hoƿ* 'to view, observe' + *-er* (agent suffix).
[^ƿildƿaren]: Literally *ƿildƿare* 'furs (product)' + *-en* (adjectival suffix
    meaning "to be made up of").
[^hƿole]: Despite not coming from historical /hw/, English *whole* formed the
    ⟨wh⟩ digraph due to disambiguation with English *hole*. In a world where
    ⟨wh⟩ was instead ⟨hƿ⟩, it is likely that they would use that instead.
[^sƿund]: An irregular verb whose lemma is *swind*/*sƿind*.
[^lie]: From New/Modern English, this usage of *lie* here means “the way,
    direction, or position in which something lies”.
[^ƿriþing]: The original English word used here, *wriggling*, is not of Old
    English origin, and was instead borrowed in the late 15th century from
    Middle Low German *wrigglen*. It is likely we would've borrowed this
    anyway, but I opted to use an existing English synonym that was purely
    English instead.
[^chaffer]: *chaffer*/*ceafer* comes from English *cheap* + *fare*. *cheap*
    penultimately comes from Proto-Germanic *\*kaupo*, which itself comes from
    Latin *caupo*.
[^workstead]: A calque of English *work* + stead '*place*'.
[^deal-with]: From Etymonline: “To *deal with* "handle, act toward (in some
    way)" is attested from mid-15c., from the notion of "engage in mutual
    intercourse, have to do with;" in late 14c. the phrase also mean "have
    sexual intercourse with."” This meaning came far later than 1066, having
    occurred around 1450, and came from the verb which came from Old English.
    Therefore, I think it is safe to use.
