### I
One morning, as Gregor Samsa ƿas ƿaking up from harroƿing dreams, he fund ute
þat in bed he had been ƿent into a fifelisc ƿigsum[^ƿigsum] bug. He lay on his
harƿeed-hard back and saƿ, as he lifted his head up a littel, his brune,
inboƿed belly sced into stiff boƿ-like deals. From þis heigt þe bedspread, nige

which he had cut out of an meted magazine a little while ago and set in a
pretty gilt frame. It was a meting of a woman with a fur hat and a fur scifel.
She sat aheafed there, lifting up in the steer of the hoƿer[^hoƿer] a stark fur
muff into which her whole forearm sƿund.
