## Story

### I
One morning, as Gregor Samsa ƿas ƿaking up from harroƿing dreams, he fund ute
þat in bed he had been ƿent into a fifelisc ƿigsum[^ƿigsum] bug. He lay on his
harƿeed-hard back and saƿ, as he lifted his head up a littel, his brune,
inboƿed belly sced into stiff boƿ-like deals. From þis heigt þe bedspread, nige
on ready to slide off altogeþer, could hardly abide still. His manifold scanks,
armly þin next to þe rest of his felly, flickered helplessly before his eyes.

“Hƿat's happened to me,” he þought. It ƿas no dream. His room, a fitting room
for a man, only sumhƿat too small, lay hushedly betƿeen þe four ƿell-knoƿn
ƿalls. Abufe þe beed, on hƿic an unpacked hoard of foresmack[^foresmack] cloþ
goods ƿas spread ute (Samsa ƿas a ƿayfaring salesman) hung þe meting hƿic he
had cut ute of a meted monþly book a little hƿile ago and set in a pretty gilt
rim. It ƿas a meting of a ƿuman mid a ƿildƿaren[^ƿildƿaren] hat and a ƿildƿaren
scifel. She sat aheafed þere, heafing up in þe steer of þe hoƿer[^hoƿer] a
stark fur glof into hƿic her hƿole[^hƿole] forearm sƿund.

Gregor's glance then trended to the window. The dreary weather (the rain drops
were falling audibly down on the metal window ledge) made him quite melancholy.
"Why don't I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all this
ƿitlessness," he thought. But this was hƿolly[^hƿole] impractical, for he was
used to sleeping on his right side, and in his present state he couldn't get
himself into this position. Huefer hard he threw himself onto his right
side, he always rolled again onto his back. He must have tried it a hundred
times, closing his eyes, so that he would not have to see the wriggling legs,
and gave up only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in his side which he
had never felt before.
