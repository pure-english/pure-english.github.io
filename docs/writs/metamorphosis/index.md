## Story

### I
One morning, as Gregor Samsa ƿas ƿaking up from harroƿing dreams, he fund ute
þat in bed he had been ƿent into a fifelisc ƿigsum[^ƿigsum] bug. He lay on his
harƿeed-hard back and saƿ, as he lifted his head up a littel, his brune,
inboƿed belly sced into stiff boƿ-like deals. From þis heigt þe bedspread, nige
on ready to slide off altogeþer, could hardly abide still. His manifold scanks,
armly þin next to þe rest of his felly, flickered helplessly before his eyes.

“Hƿat's happened to me,” he þought. It ƿas no dream. His room, a fitting room
for a man, only sumhƿat too small, lay hushedly betƿeen þe four ƿell-knoƿn
ƿalls. Abufe þe beed, on hƿic an unpacked hoard of foresmack[^foresmack] cloþ
goods ƿas spread ute (Samsa ƿas a ƿayfaring salesman) hung þe meting hƿic he
had cut ute of a meted monþly book a little hƿile ago and set in a pretty gilt
rim. It ƿas a meting of a ƿuman mid a ƿildƿaren[^ƿildƿaren] hat and a
ƿildƿaren[^ƿildƿaren] scifel. She sat aheafed þere, heafing up in þe steer of
þe hoƿer[^hoƿer] a stark fur glof into hƿic her hole forearm sƿund.
