# The Final Speech from The Great Dictator

Or: *The Last Speech from The Great Strongman*

One of my favourite monologues of all time. Written in a more liberal Anglish,
getting rid of only the French influences, allowing Norse words.

## Speech

I’m sorry, but I don’t wish to be a coaser. That’s not my business. I don’t
wish to wield or overwin anyone. I should like to help everyone - if I can -
Joudishman, Theedly man - black man - white. We all wish to help one another.
Men are like that. We wish to live by each other’s happiness - not by each
other’s woe. We don’t wish to hate and loathe one another. In this world there
is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can afford for everyone.
The way of life can be free and lovely, but we have lost the way.

Greed has befouled men’s souls, has hindered the world with hate, has
goose-stepped us into woe and bloodshed. We have fostered speed, but we have
shut ourselves in. Sarehood[^Sarehood] that gives wealth has left us in
craving. Our cunning has made us grim. Our wit, hard and unkind. We think too
much and feel too little. More than sarehood we need mannishness. More than
wit, we need kindness and softness. Without these makings, life will be bloody
and all will be lost…

The flightcraft and the *radio* have brought us nearer together. The sundry
being of these findles chys out for the goodness in men - chys out for alkin
brotherhood - for the togetherness of us all. Even now my steven is reaching
thousands of thousands throughout the world - thousands of thousands of
hopeless wepmen, women, and little children - tivers of a network that makes
men flay and lock up sackless folk.

To those who can hear me, I say - do not lose heart. The woe that is now upon
us is but the fleetingness of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of
mannish headway. The hate of men will end, and strongmen queal, and the might
they took from the folk will come back to the folk. And so long as men ago,
freedom will never dead…

Ferdmen! don’t give yourselves to wildmen - men who loathe you - bethew you -
who rain your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who
tight you - lessen you - deal with you like livestock, note you as *greatgun
fodder*[^greatgun-fodder]. Don’t give yourselves to these unkindly men - sare
men with sare minds and sare hearts! You are not sares! You are not livestock!
You are men! You have the love of mankind in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only
the unloved hate - the unloved and the unkindly! Ferdmen! Don’t fight for
thewdom! Fight for freedom!

In the 17th Heading of Hallow Luck it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within
man” - not one man nor a set of men, but in all men! In you! You, the folk have
the might - the might to make sares. The might to make happiness! You, the
folk, have the might to make this life free and lovely, to make this life a
wonderful sithe.

Then - in the name of folkdom - let us note that might - let us all come
together. Let us fight for a new world - a rightminded world that will give men
an opening to work - that will give youth a tomorrow and old lifetime a
soundness. By the oath of these things, wildmen have risen to leadership. But
they lie! They do not fulfil that oath. They never will!

Strongmen free themselves but they bethew the folk! Now let us fight to fulfil
that oath! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with theedish lets - to
do away with greed, with hate and narrow-mindedness. Let us fight for a world
of rode, a world where cunning and headway will lead to all men’s happiness.
Ferdmen! in the name of folkdom, let us all stand together!

<!-- Footnotes -->
[^Sarehood]: A newly made word meaning "machinery". It comes from Anglish
    *sare* meaning 'an artifice, a machination, a machine, a device, an engine'
    and the suffix *-hood* meaning 'a group or collection' (as in English
    brotherhood and monkhood). This word essentially means 'a group of
    machines'.
<!-- [^overharm]: A newly made word meaning "torture". It comes from the prefix
    *over-* meaning "showing excess" and the English verb *harm* meaning, well,
    to harm. Thus, *overharm* means "to excessively harm; torture". -->
[^greatgun-fodder]: A calque of English *cannon fodder*, which itself is a
    calque from German *Kanonenfutter*.

<!-- Speech
I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…

Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
