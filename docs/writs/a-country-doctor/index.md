## Story
I was in a bind. An earnest wayfare was ayenst me. An earnestly sick man was
biding for me in a thorp ten *miles* far. A swingeing snowstorm filled the room
between him and me. I had a wain — a light one, with great wheels, wholly
fitting for our rich roads. Bewoven in wildware mid the cod of tools in my
hand, I was already standing in the worth ready for the wayfare; but the horse
was missing — the horse. My own horse had quole yesternight, owing to overwork
in this icy winter. My handmaid was at that right time hurrying about the thorp
to see if she could borrow a horse, but it was hopeless — I knew that — and I
stood there worthless, more and more beset mid snow, becoming all the time more
steadfast. The girl showed up at the foreyate, alone. She was swinging the
bloakern. Needless to say, who is now going to lend her her[^her-her] horse for
such a wayfare? I walked once ayen thwarst the worth. I couldn’t see what to
do. Woored and gramed, I spurned my foot ayenst the cracked door of the swine
sty which had not been noted for years. The door opened and pounded loudly to
and fro on its hinges. A warmth and smell as if from horses came out. A dim
stall bloakern on a rope wawed inside. A man shrunk down in the stall below
showed his open hewn-eyed anlet. “Shall I *hitch*[^hitch] up?” he asked,
crawling out on all fours. I didn’t know what to say and bent down to see what
was still in the stall. The handmaid stood beside me. “One doesn’t know the
kinds of things one has put away in one’s own house,” she said, and we both
laughed. “Hey Brother, hey Sister,” the horse-hew remed out, and two horses,
mighty deer with strong sides, shoved her way one behind the other, shanks nigh
the bodies, lowering her well-shaped heads like *camels*, and yetting through
the door room, which hy thoroughly filled, only through the strong wamble of
her behinds. But right away hy stood up straight, long shanked, with thick
steaming bodies. “Help him,” I said, and the girl towardly hurried to hand the
wain *harness* to the horse-hew. But as soon as she was beside him, the
horse-hew puts his arms around her and potes his anlet against hers. She
screams out and runs over to me. On the girl’s cheek were red marks from two
rows of teeth. “Thou deer,” I reme out in wrath, “dost thou want the *whip*?”
But I at once umbethink that he is a fremmedling, that I don’t know where he
comes from, and that he’s helping me out of his own free will, when everyone
else is choosing not to. As if he knows what I was thinking, he is not grilled
at my threat, but twists back to me once more, still busy mid the horses. Then
he says, “Climb in,” and, in sooth, everything is ready. I nim heed that I have
never before fared mid such a stunning team of horses, and I climb in happily.
“But I’ll nim the *reins*. Thou dost not know the way,” I say. “By all means,”
he says; “I’m not going with thee. I’m biding mid Rosa.” “No,” screams Rosa and
runs into the house, mid a dead-on forewarning of the mustbeness[^mustbeness]
of her wird. I hear the door rackent reeseing as she sets it ready. I hear the
lock swey. I see how furthermore she runs down the row[^row] and through the
rooms putting out all the lights for the sake of making herself unmightly to
find. “You’re coming with me,” I say to the horse-hew, "or I’ll give up the
wayfare, however earnest it is. It’s not my inhide to give you the girl as the
loave of the fare.” “Yiddy-up,” he says and *claps*[^claps] his hands. The wain
is torn away, like a bit of wood in a farth. I still hear how the door of my
house is breaking down and splitting asunder under the horse-hew’s
onslaught[^onslaught], and then my eyes and ears are filled with a roaring swey
which overwhelms all my feelings at once. But only for an eyeblink. Then I am
already there, as if the barton of my sickwere opens up at once afore my worth
yate. The horses stand whistly. The snowfall has stopped, moonlight all around.
The sick were’s folks hurled out of the house, his sister behind hem. Hy almost
heave me out of the wain. I yet nothing from her addled talking. In the sick
room one can hardly breathe the lift. The forsaken *cooking stove* is smoking.
I want to pote open the eyedoor, but first I’ll look at the sick were. Thin,
without rith, not cold, not warm, with empty eyes, without a shirt, the young
man under the crammed bedspread heaves himself up, hangs about my throat, and
whispers in my ear, “Leech, let me dead.” I look about. No one has heard. The
alders stand stilly, leaning forward, and bide for my thoughts.

<!-- Footnotes -->
[^her-her]: Due to the merging of "her" and "their" into "her", this sentence
    may seem ambiguous. Explicitly, it is "who is now going to lend \[the
    handmaid\] their horse for such a wayfare?"
[^hitch]: Of unknown origin.
[^mustbeness]: A newly coined word meaning "inevitability". It comes from
    "must-be", a New English word meaning "The inevitable; that which is fated
    to happen." according to the OED, along with the dead suffix *-ness* that
    is attached to adjectives to form nouns denoting a state or condition.
    Thus, "mustbeness" means "the state or condition of being inevitable".
[^row]: Revived obsolete sense meaning "corridor".
[^claps]: Either from Old English or Old Norse, but at least half the senses
    are probably influenced from Old Norse. However, no other Anglish
    alternative exists, so this will have to do.
[^onslaught]: Formed within English with fully Anglish words, but it was
    modelled on Dutch *aanslag*.
