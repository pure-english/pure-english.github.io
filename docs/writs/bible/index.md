## Style Guide

### Abbreviations

* When using non-English words or English words that have a different meaning,
  edit `includes/abbreviations.md` and place the meaning in there (if there is
  one overarching meaning to the word).
    * If the word has multiple meanings, place your abbreviation in the same
      file and specify the meaning or meanings that apply.

### Vocabulary

* Prioritize native Old English-derived terms where you can, even over more
  common Norse words
* Using Latin words are fine if there are no Germanic equivalents and the words
  entered through Old English
* Try Germanic English equivalents and constructions over revived Anglish words

### Words

* Use *hy/hem/her/hers* over *they/them/their/theirs*. Use this as a
  gender-neutral word 3rd person singular too.
* *She* will be used.
* Instead of *hang*, use *hing* as the simple past of *hang*, and *hangen* as
  the past participle.
    * *I hing a picture on the wall yesterday.*
    * *He had hangen his face in shame.*
    * *Hanged* is still used in the sense of *killing someone by hanging*
* *with* in the sense of "together with" uses *mid* instead. *with* in the
  sense of "against" is used.

*[hing]: hung
*[hangen]: hung

### Pronouns

* Use *thou/thee/thy/thine/thyself* for second person singular **ALWAYS**.
  Likewise, use *ye/you/your/yours/yourselves* for second person plural
  **ALWAYS**. The T-V distinction of using the plural for politeness arose from
  French influence.

### Verbs

* Use *-eth* over *-s* for the third person singular present conjugation.
  According to [this][n-vb], the *-s* can be linked to Norse influence.
* Use *be* instead of *are*. According to [this][n-be], Norse influence made
  *are* become prominent over the East Midlands *ben*, which would today be
  *be*.

* Favour using *-er* and *-est* over *more* and *most*, as the use of the
  latter two is linked to French influence.
