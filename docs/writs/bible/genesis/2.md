# Genesis 2

1. Thus the heavens and the earth were done, all the heap of hem.
2. And on the seventh day God ended her work which hy had made; and hy rested
   on the seventh day from all her work which hy had made.
3. And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it: for on it hy had rested
   from all the work which God made.
4. These are the tellings of the heavens and of the earth when hy were made, in
   the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,
5. And no shrub was yet on the earth, and no wort of the field yet grew: for
   the Lord God had not brought about rain upon the earth, and there was not a
   man to till the ground.
6. But there went up streams from the earth, and watered the whole anlet of the
   ground.
7. And the Lord God shaped a were from the dust of the ground, and breathed into
   his nostrils the breath of life; and the were became a living soul.
8. And the Lord God wortwaled a leighton eastward in Eden; and there hy put the
   were whom hy had shaped.
9. And the Lord God made every tree that is sightly and good for food grow out
   of the ground; Also in the midst of the leighton were the tree of life and
   the tree of the cunning of good and evil.
10. And an ea went out of Eden to water the leighton; and thence it was shed,
    and became four headwaters.
11. The name of the first is Pison: which belapeth the whole land of Havilah,
    where there is gold;
12. And the gold of that land is good: there is sweetwatered cud and *onyx*
    stone.
13. And the name of the other ea is Gihon: which belapeth the whole land of
    Cush.
14. And the name of the third ea is the Tigris: which goeth towards the east of
    Assyria. And the fourth ea is Euphrates.
15. And the Lord God nimmed the were, and put him into the leighton of Eden to
    tame it and to watch it.
16. And the Lord God bade the were, saying, ‘Of every tree of the leighton thou
    mayest freely eat:
17. ‘But of the tree of the cunning of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it:
    for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt wissly dead.’
18. And the Lord God said, ‘It is not good that the man should be alone; I will
    make a helper for him.’
19. And out of the ground the Lord God shaped every deer of the field, and
    every fowl of the lift; and brought hem to Adam to see what he would name
    hem: and whatever Adam named every living shaft, that was the name thereof.
20. And Adam yave names to all livestock, and to the fowl of the lift, and to
    every deer of the field; but for Adam a helper was not found.
21. And the Lord God brought about a deep sleep upon Adam, and he slept: and he
    nimmed one of his ribs, and ditted up the flesh instead thereof;
22. And the rib, which the Lord God had nimmen from a were, hy made into a
    wife, and hy brought her to the were.
23. And Adam said, ‘This is now the bone of my bones, and the flesh of my
    flesh: she shall be named Woman, for she was nimmen out of Man.’[^Eve]
24. Therefore a were shall leave his father and his mother, and be bound to his
    wife: and hy shall be one flesh.
25. And hy were bo naked, the were and his wife, and were not ashamed.

[^Eve]: "man" here means "human being", not an adult male human, but the pun
    still works, as she *was* taken from a human being. She's just one now
    also.
