# Genesis 2 - Adam and Ewe

1. Thus the heavens and the earth were made whole in all her widegale umbeight.
2. By the seventh day God had fuldid the work hy had been doing; so on the
   seventh day he rested from all her work.
3. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, for on it hy rested from
   all the work of making that he had done.
4. This is the account of the heavens and the earth when hy were made, when the
   LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
5. Now no shrub had yet arose on the earth and no wort had yet sprung up, for
   the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the
   ground,
6. but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole bred of the ground.
7. Then the LORD God shaped a were from the dust of the ground, and breathed
   into his nostrils the breath of life, and the were became a living being.
8. Now the LORD God had wortwaled a garden in the east, in *Eden*; and there hy
   put the were hy had shaped.
9. The LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground – trees that
   were sightly and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of
   life and the tree of the cunning[^cunning] of good and evil.
10. An ea watering the garden flowed from *Eden*; from there it was broken up
    into four headwaters.
11. The name of the first is the *Pishon*; it winds through the whole land of
    Havilah, where there is gold.
12. (The gold of that land is good; sweetwatered cud and *onyx* are also
    there.)
13. The name of the twoth river is the Gihon; it winds through the whole land
    of Cush[^Cush].
14. The name of the third river is the *Tigris*; it runs along the east side of
    Ashur. And the fourth river is the *Euphrates*.
15. The LORD God took the were and put him in the Garden of *Eden* to work it
    and take care of it.
16. And the LORD God commanded the were, ‘Thou art free to eat from any tree in
    the garden;
17. but thou must not eat from the tree of the cunning of good and evil, for
    when thou eatest from it thou willest wissly dead.’
18. The LORD God said, ‘It is not good for the were to be alone. I will make a
    helper worthy for him.’
19. Now the LORD God had shaped out of the ground all the wild deer and all the
    birds in the lift. He brought hem to the were to see what he would name
    hem; and whatever the were named each living deer, that was its name.
20.
