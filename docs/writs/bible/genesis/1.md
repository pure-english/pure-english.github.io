# Genesis 1

1. In the beginning God made the heavens and the earth.
2. And the earth was without shape, and empty; and darkness was upon the anlet
   of the depths. And the Ghost of God stirred upon the anlet of the water.
3. And God said, “Let there be light”: and there was light.
4. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God shed the light from the
   darkness.
5. And God named the light ‘Day’, and the darkness he named ‘Night’. And the
   evening and the morning went by: the first day.
6. And God said, ‘Let there be a rodder in the midst of the waters, and let it
   shed the water from the water.’
7. And God made the rodder, and shed the waters which were under the rodder
   from the waters which were above the rodder: and it was so.
8. And God named the rodder ‘Heaven’. And the evening and the morning went by:
   the other day.
9. And God said, ‘Let the water under the heaven be gathered together unto one
   spot, and let the dry land come out’: and it was so.
10. And God named the dry land ‘Earth’; and the gathering together of the
    waters named he ‘Seas’: and God saw that it was good.
11. And God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth grass, the wort yielding seed, and
    the ovet tree yielding ovet after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon
    the earth’: and it was so.
12. And the earth brought forth grass, and wort yielding seed after its kind,
    and the tree yielding ovet, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and
    God saw that it was good.
13. And the evening and the morning went by: the third day.
14. And God said, ‘Let there be lights in the rodder of the heaven to shed the
    day from the night; and let hem be for tokens, and for yeartides, and for
    days, and years’:
15. And let hem be for lights in the rodder of the heaven to yeave light upon
    the earth: and it was so.
16. And God made two great lights; the greater light to wield the day, and the
    lesser light to wield the night: he made the stars also.
17. And God set hem in the rodder of the heaven to yeave light upon the earth,
18. And to wield over the day and over the night, and to shed the light from
    the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
19. And the evening and the morning went by: the fourth day.
20. And God said, ‘Let the water bring forth overflowingly the agoing shaft
    that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open rodder of
    heaven.’
21. And God made great seadeer, and every living shaft that moveth, which the
    water brought forth overflowingly, after her kind, and every feathered fowl
    after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
22. And God blessed hem, saying, ‘Be wassombere, and tider, and fill the waters
    in the seas, and let fowl tider in the earth.’
23. And the evening and the morning went by: the fifth day.
24. And God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth the living shaft after its kind,
    livestock, and creeping thing, and deer of the earth after its kind’: and
    it was so.
25. And God made the deer of the earth after its kind, and livestock after her
    kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind: and God
    saw that it was good.
26. And God said, ‘Let us make man in our anlikeness, after our likeness: and
    let hem have lordship over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
    lift, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every
    creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’
27. So God made man in her own anlikeness, in the anlikeness of God hy made
    him; werely and wifely hy made hem.
28. And God blessed hem, and God said unto hem, ‘Be wassombere, and tider, and
    fill the earth, and tame it: and have lordship over the fish of the sea,
    and over the fowl of the lift, and over every living thing that moveth upon
    the earth.’
29. And God said, ‘Behold, I have yeaven you every wort bearing seed, which is
    upon the anlet of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the ovet
    of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.’
30. And to every deer of the earth, and to every fowl of the lift, and to every
    thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have yeaven
    every green wort for food: and it was so.
31. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was full good.
    And the evening and the morning went by: the sixth day.
