# Genesis 3 - The Fall

1. Now the snake was more cunning than any other deer of the field which the
   Lord God had made. And he said to the wife, ‘Hath God soothly said, “Ye
   shall not eat of every tree of the leighton”?’
2. And the wife said to the snake, ‘We may eat of the ovet of the trees of the
   leighton:
3. But of the ovet of the tree which is in the midst of the leighton, God hath
   said, “Ye shall not eat  neither shall ye rine it, lest ye dead.”’
4. And the snake said to the wife, ‘Ye shall not wissly dead:
5. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened,
   and ye shall be like God, knowing good and evil.’
6. And when the wife saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
   sightly, and willsome to making one wise, she nimmed of the ovet thereof,
   and did eat, and yave also to her were who was with her; and he did eat.
7. And the eyes of hem bo were opened, and hy knew that hy were naked; and hy
   sewed fike leaves together, and made hemselves hames.
8. And hy heard the steven of the Lord God walking in the leighton in the cool
   of the day: and Adam and his wife hid hemselves from the anwardness of the
   Lord God amongst the trees of the leighton.
9. And the Lord God boded to Adam, and said to him, ‘Where art thou?’
10. And Adam answered, ‘I heard thy steven in the leighton, and I was fearful,
    as I was naked; and I hid myself.’
11. And hy said, ‘Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the
    tree, whereof I bade thee that thou shouldst not eat?’
12. And the were said, ‘The wife whom thou yavest to be mid me, she yave me
    ovet of the tree, and I did eat.’
13. And the Lord God said to the wife, ‘What is this that thou hast done?’ And
    the wife said, ‘The snake misled me, and I did eat.’
14. And the Lord God said to the snake, ‘Since thou hast done this, thou art
    mansed above all livestock, and above every deer of the field; upon thy
    belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
15. And I will put foeship between thee and the wife, and between thy seed and
    her seed; he shall mash thy head, and thou shalt strike his heel.’
16. To the wife he said, ‘I will greatly feelfold thy sorrow and thy begetting;
    in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy list shall be to thy
    were, and he shall wield over thee.’
17. And to Adam he said, ‘Since thou hast listened to the steven of thy wife,
    and hast eaten of the tree, of which I bade thee, saying, “Thou shalt not
    eat of it”: mansed is the ground thanks to thee; in sorrow shalt thou eat
    of it all the days of thy life;
18. ‘Thorns and thistles also shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat
    the wort of the field;
19. In the sweat of thy leer shalt thou eat bread, oth thou edwend to the
    ground; for out of it wast thou nimmed: for dust thou art, and to dust
    shalt thou edwend.
20. And Adam named his wife Ewe; for she would become the mother of all living.
21. Also to Adam and to his wife did the Lord God make poads of hide, and
    clothed hem.
22. And the Lord God said, ‘Behold, the were has now become like one of us,
    knowing good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and nim also of
    the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:’
23. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the leighton of Eden, to till
    the ground whence he was nimmed.
24. So hy drove out the were; and hy put at the east of the leighton of Eden
    Cherubims, and a leaming sword which twisted every way, to ward the way of
    the tree of life.
