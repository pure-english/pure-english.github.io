1. And Adam knew Ewe his wife; and she became with child, and bore Cain, and
   said, ‘I have brought forth a man from the Lord.[^Cain]’
2. And she ayen bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain
   was a tiller of the ground.
3. And in time it came to ago, that Cain brought of the ovet of the ground an
   tiver to the Lord.
4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat
   thereof. And the Lord nimmed a liking to Abel and his tiver:
5. But to Cain and his tiver he did not nim a liking. And Cain was highly
   wroth, and his ansen fell.
6. And the Lord said to Cain, ‘Why art thou wroth? and why is thy ansen fallen?
7. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be welcomed? and if thou doest not well,
   sin lieth at the door. And to thee shall be his list, and thou shalt wield
   over him.
8. And Cain talked mid his brother Abel: and it came to ago, when hy were in
   the field, that Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.
9. And the Lord said to Cain, ‘Where is thy brother Abel?’ And he said, ‘I know
   not: Am I my brother's keeper?’
10. And hy said, ‘What hast thou done? the steven of thy brother's blood chyeth
    to me from the ground.
11. ‘And now thou art mansed from the earth, which hath opened its mouth to
    reap thy brother's blood from thy hand;
12. ‘When thou tillest the ground, it shall henceforth not yield its
    strength[^strength] to thee; thou shalt be a runaway and a drifter on the
    earth.’
13. And Cain said to the Lord, ‘My wrake is greater than I can bear.
14. ‘Behold, thou hast driven me out from the anlet of the earth this day; and
    from thy anlet shall I be hid; and I shall be a runaway and a drifter on
    the earth; and it shall come to ago, that every one that findeth me shall
    slay me.’
15. And the Lord said to him, ‘Not so; anyone who slayeth Cain, wrake shall be
    nimmed on hem sevenfold.’ And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any man
    finding him should slay him.
16. And Cain went out from the anwardness of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of
    Nod, to the east of Eden.
17. And Cain made love to his wife; and she beyot and bore Enoch: and he built
    a borough, and named it after his son, Enoch.
18. And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad beyat Mehujael: and Mehujael beyat
    Methushael[^Methushael]: and Methushael beyat Lamech.
19. And Lamech wed two wives: the name of the first was Adah, and the name of
    the other was Zillah.
20. And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in fieldhouses
    and own livestock.
21. And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all those who
    glew[^glew] stringed tools and whistles.
22. And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, who hewed all kinds of tools from
    brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.
23. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, ‘Hear my steven; ye wives of
    Lamech, listen to my speech: for I have slain a man for wounding me, a
    young man for harming me.
24. If Cain shall be wrakened[^wrakened] sevenfold, then Lamech shall be
    wrakened seventy-sevenfold.
25. And Adam made love to his wife ayen; and she bore a son and named him Seth:
    ‘For God,’ she said, ‘hath atithed me another child instead of Abel, whom
    Cain slew.’
26. And to Seth, there was also born a son; and he named him Enosh: then men
    began to chy upon the name of the Lord.

<!-- Abbreviations -->


<!-- Footnotes -->
[^Cain]: The Hebrew word for Cain, *קַיִן* (qayin) sounds like the Hebrew word
    for "brought forth": *קָנָה* (qānâ).
[^strength]: The literal translation is "strength" or "ability", but many
    translations use the term "resources", "crops", "produce", and "wealth"
    when referring to soil.
[^Methushael]: Was *Methusael* in the KJV, but the origin Hebrew was *מְתוּשָׁאֵל*
    (mᵉtûšā’ēl), with a "sh" sound.
[^glew]: Would use *play* here, but it is of uncertain origin. OED suggests it
    may be Germanic, as Middle Dutch has *pleyen*, but there is no further
    evidence for Germanic origins. *glew* here instead also encodes information
    about playing music, which is good too.
[^wrakened]: A new word coined from *wrake* 'punishment, vengeance' and the
    verbal suffix *-en* meaning 'to give or obtain something'. Thus, *wraken*
    means 'to give or obtain vengeance; avenge'.
