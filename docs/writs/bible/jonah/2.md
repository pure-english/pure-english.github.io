# Jonah 2

1. Then Jonah bade to the Lord his God out of the fish's belly,
2. And said, ‘I chyed by grounds of mine arveth to the Lord, and hy heard me;
   out of the belly of hell I chyed, and thou heardest my steven.
3. For thou hadst thrown me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the
   floods umbewent me: all thy waves and thy breakers awent over me.
4. Then I said, “I am outed from thy sight; yet I will look ayen towards thy
   holy harrow.”
5. The waters umbewent me, even to the soul: the depth shut about me, the weeds
   were bewoven about my head.
6. I went down to the bottoms of the barrows; the earth barred me in for ever:
   yet thou hast brought up my life from filing, O Lord my God.
7. When my soul grew wan within me I brought to mind the Lord: and my bede went
   to thee, into thine holy harrow.
8. Hy that behold lying selfweenings forsake her own leeth.
9. But I will bloot to thee mid the steven of thanksgiving; I will yield that
   which I have behighted. Aleesedness is of the Lord.’
10. And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it hurled out Jonah upon the dry land.
